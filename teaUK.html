        <p class="captions_blog">Tea in the United Kingdom</p>
            <img src="item1.jpg">
            <div class="blog_content"><span>Since the 18th century the United Kingdom has been one of the world's greatest tea consumers, with an average per capita tea supply of 1.9 kg (4.18 lbs) per year. The British Empire was instrumental in spreading tea from China to India; British interests controlled tea production in the subcontinent. Tea, which was an upper-class drink in Europe, became the infusion of every class in Great Britain in the course of the 18th century and has remained so. The role of tea in British culture and history should not be under-estimated.</span>
                <br>
                <span>In the United Kingdom, the drinking of tea is so varied that it is quite hard to generalise. While it is usually served with milk, it is not uncommon to drink it black or with lemon, with sugar being a popular addition to any of the above. Strong tea, served in mug with milk and sugar, is a popular combination known as builder's tea.</span><br>
                <span>The first record of tea written in English came from English merchants abroad. In 1615, Richard Wickham, who ran an East India Company office in Japan, wrote in a letter to merchants in Macao requesting that they bring him "a pot of the best sort of chaw". Peter Mundy, a traveller and merchant who came across tea in Fujian, China in 1637, wrote, "chaa — only water with a kind of herb boyled in it ".</span>
                <br>
                <span>Green tea exported from China was first introduced in the coffeehouses of London shortly before the Stuart Restoration (1660); in 1657, tea was offered as an item in a London coffeehouse in Exchange Alley. The owner Thomas Garraway had to explain the new beverage in a pamphlet, and an advertisement in Mercurius Politicus for 30 September 1658 offered "That Excellent, and by all Physicians approved, China drink, called by the Chinese, Tcha, by other nations Tay alias Tee, ...sold at the Sultaness-head, ye Cophee-house in Sweetings-Rents, by the Royal Exchange, London". In London "Coffee, chocolate and a kind of drink called tee" were "sold in almost every street in 1659", according to Thomas Rugge's Diurnall. Tea was mainly consumed by upper and mercantile classes: Samuel Pepys, curious for every novelty, tasted the new drink in 1660 and recorded the experience in his diary: [25 September] "I did send for a cup of tee, (a China drink) of which I had never had drunk before". That same year, two pounds, two ounces of tea bought from Portugal were formally presented to Charles II by the British East India Company. Some years later, in 1667, Pepys noted that his wife was taking tea on medical advice – "a drink which Mr Pelling the Pottecary tells her is good for her colds and defluxions". The Royal College of Physicians debated whether any of the exotic new hot drinks would "agree with the Constitutions of our English bodies".</span>
                <br>
                <span>The earliest English equipages for making tea date to the 1660s. Small porcelain tea bowls were used by the fashionable; they were occasionally shipped with the tea itself. Tea-drinking spurred the search for a European imitation of Chinese porcelain, first successfully produced in England at the Chelsea porcelain manufactory, established around 1743-45 and quickly imitated. See tea set.</span>
                <br>
                <span>British workers have the right in law to a minimum of a 20-minute break in a shift of six hours; government guidelines describe this as " a tea or lunch break". More informally, this is known as elevenses, i.e. a couple of hours before the mid-day meal, traditionally served at 1pm.</span>
                <br>
                <span>When the British have a "cuppa" (a cup of tea), there is usually a biscuit nearby. Dunking biscuits in tea is a custom that was exported around the globe. McVitie's biscuits are the most popular biscuits in the UK to "dunk" in tea, with McVitie's chocolate digestives, Rich tea and Hobnobs ranked the nation's top three favourite biscuits in 2009.</span>
                <br>
                <span>Tea is not only the name of the beverage, but of a light meal. Anna Russell, Duchess of Bedford is credited with the creation of afternoon tea circa 1840. She thought of the idea to ward off hunger between luncheon and dinner, as the latter was being served later and later. The tradition continues to this day. There is a tradition of tea rooms in the UK which provide the traditional fare of cream and jam on scones, a combination commonly known as cream tea. While these establishments have declined in popularity since World War II, there are still many tea rooms to be found in the countryside. In Devon and Cornwall particularly, cream teas are a speciality.</span>

            <div class="blog_content"><span>In China, long before tea became the beverage of choice and a way of life, it was considered a medicinal staple. Tea was not only a treatment for individual illnesses, but was also a general health tonic, said to promote long life and vitality. Even today, in traditional Chinese medicine, green teas and pu-erhs are prescribed for a variety of complaints, especially as modern research has come to support many of these claims. Tea was also used by those wishing to achieve better results while meditating, and became popular with Buddhist priests who later introduced it to the aristocratic circles. For some time, only people of high standing in the imperial courts and these select priests were able to drink tea on a regular basis. But later on, tea became more widely available to all people, and the lower classes were finally able to enjoy tea more frequently.</span> <a href="tea_traditions.html" class="unfold">(See more)</a>

            <div class="blog_content"><span>Since the 18th century the United Kingdom has been one of the world's greatest tea consumers, with an average per capita tea supply of 1.9 kg (4.18 lbs) per year. The British Empire was instrumental in spreading tea from China to India; British interests controlled tea production in the subcontinent. Tea, which was an upper-class drink in Europe, became the infusion of every class in Great Britain in the course of the 18th century and has remained so. The role of tea in British culture and history should not be under-estimated.</span>
                <br>
                <span>In the United Kingdom, the drinking of tea is so varied that it is quite hard to generalise. While it is usually served with milk, it is not uncommon to drink it black or with lemon, with sugar being a popular addition to any of the above. Strong tea, served in mug with milk and sugar, is a popular combination known as builder's tea.</span>

            <div class="blog_content"><span>Dating back to the mid-1800s, the tradition of afternoon tea was first introduced by the aristocracy of England and its colonies. Since then, the formal meal has infiltrated the worldâ€™s most elite hotels, historic museums, and kitschy patisseries, allowing the masses to enjoy decadent three-tiered servings of finger sandwiches, tiny cakes, and strawberries with Devonshire cream. As an alternative to holiday cocktails, warm-up with afternoon tea at one of our recommended locales, from traditional luxury hotels to homey, rustic cafes.</span>
